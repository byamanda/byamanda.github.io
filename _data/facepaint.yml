    comment: Amanda was amazing for our twin girlâ€™s 4th Birthday Party. She was early for the set time, set up quickly and painted the most beautiful full face and partial face designs. All of the children loved their face paintings. We were beyond impressed with Amanda and her creative work! Highly recommend!

    comment: We hired Amanda for an Amazon team event on Halloween this year, and she was such an absolute pleasure to work with! To start, she arrived with plenty of time to set up before the event began, which I always appreciate. As the event began, many were too shy to get their faces painted, but as they noticed some of the exceptional work she had done for others, they started lining up to get theirs done next. She is incredibly personable, and clearly a seasoned artist, as she could literally paint ANY request that came her way with grace and ease. I can't tell you how much I appreciated the talent and professionalism of working with Amanda. We will certainly be recommending her to other teams, and will be inviting her back for future events. I highly recommend! Thank you, again, for making our event memorable Amanda!
