  <p>
    My inspiration stems from my environment, in which Iâ€™ve had the freedom to dream, explore 
    and combine artistic mediums into simultaneously whimsical and sincere creations. My work 
    mimics nature - both botanical and human. In the seeming simplicity of plants and flowers, I 
    incorporate intricacy using organic movement and layers, often expressed in acrylic 
    paintings over vintage maps, bright fruit prints splashed onto rocks, or ink, watercolor and 
    gouache mixed media pieces with stark backgrounds. In everything I make, I hope you find 
    some encouragement to follow your dreams and stop to smell the roses on your way.

   When not in my studio, I like to get lost exploring hiking trails, rural roads and local 
   coffee shops. Besides my art, my greatest loves are my loved ones, traveling and my orange 
   tabby, Dinah.
