Take a stroll around downtown Everett and see some amazing local art! You can stop by and say 
to hi and have a cookie on June 21st. The event is completely free! This is a great 
opportunity to bypass shipping costs as Iâ€™ll have a variety of prints and originals for 
purchase. You can stop by anytime until July 18th to see my work.
