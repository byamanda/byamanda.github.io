Citrine Health strives to create, maintain and support women's healthcare and disease 
prevention. A passion that I share. I'm excited to explore the female form through my 
"Feminism in Flowers" series and to share these pieces with you. You can stop by any time that 
Citrine is open during the month of November. Thirty percent of every purchase supports the 
non-profit so this is a great time to not only support me and my business but another local 
business that is doing great things in our community!
